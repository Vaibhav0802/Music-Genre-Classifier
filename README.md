# Music-Genre-Classi
Music genre classifier is a machine learning and deep learning based music genre classification system.
Here is how it is made:
We trained three deep learning models and two machine learning models on the GTZAN dataset which is a dataset for different music geners. We applied three neural networks and two machine learning models which are Light Gradient boosting machine and Extra Tree Classifier. Then all the models vote to get the finbal fresult. Now, when we have a new song to classify then, we use librosa libraray to extract its features and give them to the model to give us the final result i.e. the genre of that music.
